          <p class="lead">
            I'm Varun Kumar Gupta, aka Lumi, a Graphics Engineer and Technical Artist who enjoys building 
            the systems and pipelines that make creative work easier and faster. Most of my time goes into 
            procedural generation, real-time graphics, and writing tools that help artists get ideas on 
            screen without fighting the software.
          </p>

        <!-- Main content -->
        <div class="prose-custom" data-animate>
          <p>
            I focus on the engineering side of worldbuilding: procedural generation, real-time graphics, and tool development. 
            Whether it’s terrain synthesis, automated asset workflows, custom renderers, or data-driven pipelines, 
            I’m driven by one question: <em>How can code make creativity more efficient?</em>
          </p>
          
          <h2>What I Do</h2>
          
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Procedural Content Generation (PCG)</strong> : I work on rule-based systems for environments, assets, 
              and worldbuilding. If something can be defined logically, I like figuring out how to make it generate itself.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Tool Development</strong> : C++, Python, Unreal, Blender; I build tools that remove repetitive work 
              and let artists focus on the fun parts. Recently, I've been exploring lightweight AI-assisted workflows, 
              but always with the same rule: Artists first, AI later.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Technical Art</strong> : Bridging art and engineering: Shaders, materials, rigging logic, rendering 
              quirks; basically the technical glue between code and visuals.
            </li>
          </ul>
          
          <h2>Technical Foundation</h2>
          
          <p>
            Right now my work revolves around <strong>C++, Python, Unreal Engine, Blender, Houdini, and graphics programming.</strong>
            OpenGL, Vulkan, HLSL, and compute-driven techniques. I’m especially interested in GPU-heavy systems 
            and <strong>real-time procedural workflows.</strong>
          </p>

          <p>
          I completed my <strong>Master’s</strong> in <strong>Computer Science (Augmented & Virtual Reality)</strong> from <strong>Trinity College Dublin</strong>, 
          which pushed me deeper into rendering, simulation, and experimental graphics.
          </p>

          <p>
          Some of the things I’ve been working on recently:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li> 
              <strong>Procedural landscape generation</strong> using AI paired with a custom <strong>C++ OpenGL renderer</strong>.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Blender and Unreal tools</strong> focused on speeding up everyday artist workflows.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>GPU-based procedural experiments</strong> for environments, scattering systems, and rule-driven worldbuilding.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            This is the direction I’m moving toward — more engineering, more systems work, and a lot more experimentation.
          </p>

          <h2>Why I Write</h2>
          
          <p>
            I read a lot. Books, papers, weird technical blogs hidden on page 31415926 of Google, and I’ve always felt that 
            good learning material for PCG resources; especially for Blender, Unreal, and GPU workflows, are still scattered, 
            shallow, and surprisingly hard to find.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            So I write to fix that.
          </p>

          <p>
            My goal isn’t quantity, it’s clarity.
          </p>

          <p>
            Every article I publish aims to be practical, technical, and focused: the kind of content I wish existed when I was learning.
          </p>

          <p>
            I write to share what I’m building, what I’m studying, and the exact knowledge that pushes the field forward. One well-explained concept at a time.
          </p>

          <p>
            If you're exploring similar ideas or building something procedural, feel free to reach out. 
            I’m always happy to talk systems, tools, and worlds built by code.
