## Overview

My thesis project exploring the intersection of AI image generation and real-time procedural graphics. The system uses Stable Diffusion to generate landscape concepts, then reconstructs them as 3D terrain in a custom OpenGL renderer.

## Research Question

Can we use 2D AI-generated images as meaningful input for 3D procedural generation systems?

The answer, it turns out, is "yes, with significant preprocessing."

## System Architecture

```
┌─────────────────┐     ┌─────────────────┐     ┌─────────────────┐
│ Stable Diffusion│────▶│ Feature Extract │────▶│ Terrain Engine  │
│ (2D Generation) │     │ (Python/OpenCV) │     │ (C++/OpenGL)    │
└─────────────────┘     └─────────────────┘     └─────────────────┘
```

### Stage 1: AI Generation
Using Stable Diffusion with custom landscape-focused fine-tuning to generate concept images. The key was training on images with clear horizon lines and consistent lighting.

### Stage 2: Feature Extraction
A Python pipeline extracts:
- Heightmap approximation (from luminance gradients)
- Biome classification (from color clusters)
- Vegetation density (from texture analysis)

### Stage 3: Terrain Reconstruction
The C++ engine reconstructs 3D terrain using:
- GPU-accelerated heightmap generation
- Procedural detail overlay (rocks, grass, trees)
- Atmospheric scattering for consistent lighting

## Results

The system successfully generates coherent 3D landscapes from AI concepts, with some caveats:
- Works best with landscapes that have clear depth cues
- Struggles with highly stylized or abstract inputs
- Generation quality depends heavily on the source image

## Technical Challenges

1. **Depth estimation** — 2D to 3D reconstruction is inherently ambiguous
2. **Style consistency** — Matching procedural detail to AI aesthetics
3. **Performance** — Real-time rendering while processing AI features

## Outcome

- Successfully defended thesis
- Paper submitted to SIGGRAPH Asia (under review)
- Open-sourced the renderer and feature extraction pipeline

## Future Work

- Real-time Stable Diffusion integration (currently batch-processed)
- Multi-view synthesis for more accurate depth
- Vegetation and structure placement using AI suggestions
