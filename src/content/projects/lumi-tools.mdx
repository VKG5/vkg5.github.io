## Overview

Lumi Tools is a collection of Blender add-ons I built to solve recurring pain points in my illustration and 3D workflow. What started as personal scripts grew into a toolkit now used by 500+ artists.

## The Problem

Working on large illustration projects in Blender exposed several friction points:

- Repetitive setup tasks for each new file (lighting rigs, render settings, collection structures)
- No efficient way to batch-process reference images
- Manual camera setup for turntables and beauty shots
- Inconsistent export settings leading to hours of re-renders

I was spending 30% of my time on tasks that added zero creative value.

## The Approach

Rather than building one monolithic tool, I architected Lumi Tools as a modular system:

1. **Core Framework** — Shared utilities for UI, settings persistence, and undo management
2. **Independent Modules** — Each tool is self-contained and can be enabled/disabled
3. **Preset System** — User-configurable presets that sync across projects

This approach meant I could ship useful tools quickly while building toward a cohesive system.

## Tools Built

| Tool | Function |
|------|----------|
| Quick Setup | One-click scene initialization with customizable templates |
| Batch Reference | Import, organize, and process reference images |
| Turntable Pro | Automated camera rigs for product shots |
| Export Manager | Preset-based rendering with automatic naming and organization |
| Color Palette | Extract and apply palettes from reference images |

## Technical Decisions

- **Python + Blender API** — Native integration, no external dependencies
- **JSON Presets** — Human-readable, version-controllable settings
- **Lazy Loading** — Modules load only when first accessed (improves startup time)
- **Comprehensive Undo** — Every operation is fully undoable

## Outcome

- **~40% reduction** in setup time for new projects
- **500+ active users** (based on download analytics)
- **4.8/5 rating** on Blender Market

## What I'd Do Differently

1. **Start with user research.** I built for myself first, which worked, but talking to other artists earlier would have prioritized features better.
2. **Automated testing from day one.** Manual testing doesn't scale with 20+ tools.
3. **Better documentation.** Artists don't read docs, but they do watch 30-second video demos.

## Key Learning

Good tools are invisible—artists shouldn't think about the tool, only the work.
